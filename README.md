# Personal Portfolio Website
This webdesign was developed for a Portfolio Website project assignment at Codecademy

### The project required:
- At least one interactive feature using JavaScript
- Use of Git version control
- Use of the command line and file navigation
- The use of Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- The finished website be deployed to the web using GitHub Pages

### Webdesign uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Google Fonts, and fa-fontawesome icons with the following features:
- Multiple page webdesign with responsive navigation
- Sidebar navigation for computer screens
- Hamburger navigation for smaller screens (required JavaScript)
- Website page that launches web project when image is selected
- Photo page with photo images that expand when selected (required JavaScript)
- All pages are responsive to screen size by device (e.g., iPad, phone)

### Unresolved problem:
The sidebar text flickers intermittently when a menu item is selected. After some Google research, I thought this issue might be related to the y-scroll bar being present on some pages but not others. So, I added **html {overflow-y: scroll;}** to ensure a right side y-scroll bar occurs on each page except the landing page.  This lessened the text-flicker problem but did not eliminate it. Any suggestions or thoughts regarding this issue is appreciated.
